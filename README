I had fun doing the challenges, they were easy to understand, yet had a subtle complexity that made them interesting.

## Problem 1: Minesweeper
In Javascript, create a version of the classic game of Minesweeper.

# Rules of Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a grid of tiles, each of which may or may not cover hidden mines. The goal is to click on ever tile except those that have mines. When a user clicks a tile, one of two things happens. If the tile was covering a mine, the mine is revealed and the game ends in failure. If the tile was not covering a mine, it instead reveals the number of adjacent (including diagonals) tiles that are covering mines. When the user is confident that all tiles not containing mines have been clicked, the user presses a Validate button (often portrayed as a smiley-face icon) that checks the clicked tiles: if the user is correct, the game ends in victory, if not, the game ends in failure.

# Design constraints
* Use HTML, CSS, and Javascript (including jQuery, should you desire) to craft your solution.
* You may target your solution to a specific browser.
* The board should be an 8x8 grid and by default 10 hidden mines are randomly placed into the board.
* The interface should support these three functions:
* New Game - start a new, randomly generated game.
* Validate - check that a user has correctly marked all the tiles and end the game in either victory or failure.
* Cheat - in any manner you deem appropriate, reveal the locations of the mines without ending the game.
